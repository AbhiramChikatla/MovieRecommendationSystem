# Movie Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

The Movie Recommendation System project leverages machine learning algorithms to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences and viewing history. This system enhances user experience by predicting movies that users are likely to enjoy, using various filtering techniques.

## Types of Filtering

### Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering predicts user preferences by analyzing patterns in user behavior. It assumes that users who have agreed on movies in the past will continue to do so in the future.

**Example:**
- User A and User B both liked Movie X and Movie Y. If User A likes Movie Z, User B is likely to enjoy Movie Z as well.

### Content-Based Filtering

Content-based filtering recommends movies by comparing the content of movies that a user has enjoyed in the past with other movies' content. It focuses on the attributes of the movies.

**Example:**
- If a user likes sci-fi movies with a strong female lead, the system will recommend other sci-fi movies with similar characteristics.

### Hybrid Methods

Hybrid methods combine collaborative and content-based filtering to provide more accurate recommendations. These methods leverage the strengths of both approaches to overcome their individual limitations.

**Example:**
- The system uses collaborative filtering to find users with similar tastes and content-based filtering to recommend movies that match the specific preferences of those users.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Collecting and cleaning movie and user data to ensure accuracy.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Identifying relevant features for the recommendation system.
3. **Model Training**: Using algorithms to train the model on existing data.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics and fine tuning.
